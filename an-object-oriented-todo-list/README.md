# An Object-Oriented ToDo-List

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/PoYKXg](https://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/PoYKXg).

This is an Object Oriented To Do List. New Lists can be created with `var xy = new ToDoList('xy').init();` to get a list with all standard functions. 
They work with data-Attributes (for input, undo and the list itself).

Because I'm a JS beginner I appreciate all critic and feedback. :)
